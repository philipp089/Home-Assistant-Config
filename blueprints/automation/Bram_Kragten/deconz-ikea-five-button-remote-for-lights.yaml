  name: deCONZ - IKEA five button remote for lights
  description: 'Control lights with an IKEA five button remote (the round ones).


    The middle "on" button, toggle the lights on/off to the last set brightness (unless
    the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint).

    Dim up/down buttons will change the brightness smoothly and can be pressed and
    hold until the brightness is satisfactory.

    The "left" and "right" buttons can be assigned to an short and long button press
    action. This allows you to assign, e.g., a scene or anything else. '
