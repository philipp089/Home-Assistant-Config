# Google inspired Home Assistant Configuration (mobile and Desktop UI)

## Mobile-App

### The Home - Tab

The Home-Tab is the default Tab and a great way to start searching through features as it gives direct access to all tabs in the User Interface. Each label-card in the whole User-Interface leads back to the Home-Tab by pressing it.

The Home-Tab contains a custom-header with each tab above the Presence-Status. The quick access area below is maybe my mostly used way to navigate through the app, as it gives direct access to all dashboards.

Aside from that, the  Home-Tab contains a group of custom button cards for each room.

The Plugs- and the Air-Humidifier Card are custom button card templates as well as all other button card type.

### The Light - Tab

As the name suggests, in the Light-Tab I handle all my light-scripts. I almost exclusively use Philips Hue bulbs connected to a Raspbee II from dresden electronics as my Zigbee-Gateway. An old IKEA Floalt Panel is the exception. Each of the scenes is also controllable via speech over Google Assistant.

### The Media - Tab

Remote Controls for two televisions and all Media-Players (several Sonos devices, Google Nest Minis) are integrated to this dashboard.

## Desktop App

### The Home - Tab

The Desktop-App is made with Tileboard. For now i only have the first Tab finished.
